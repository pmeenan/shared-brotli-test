    <p>This test page will run several tests to determine if Shared Brotli compression will work with the server and CDN configuration that it is running behind.</p>
    <p>Specifically, it will test:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A javascript resource can respond with a "use-as-dictionary:" response header.</li>
      <li>A request for a javascript resource with "Accept-Encoding: sbr,br,gzip" and "sec-available-dictionary:" request headers pass the headers through to the back-end application server.</li>
      <li>A response with "content-encoding: sbr" is passed through from the server back to the client.</li>
      <li>Responding with "Vary: Accept-Encoding,sec-available-dictionary" partitions any intermediary caches with the appropriate response.</li>
    </ul>
